    ## JS and HTML Injection
      There are a bunch of methods to inject text or HTML into a document using JS
      Mainly, they're considered "unsafe" because they can spoof a page pretty easily
      But they're useful for starting to understand how websites work
      the usual ones are element.innerText and element.innerHTML
      Here's an article on the differences if you want to know more:
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/textContent#differences_from_innertext
    ## What to do in this function
      - Accept a list of restaurant objects
      - using a .forEach method, inject a list element into your index.html for every element in the list
      - Display the name of that restaurant and what category of food it is

      ## Process Data Separately From Injecting It
        This function should accept your 1,000 records
        then select 15 random records
        and return an object containing only the restaurant's name, category, and geocoded location
        So we can inject them using the HTML injection function
        You can find the column names by carefully looking at your single returned record
        https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Health/Food-Inspection/umjn-t2iz
      ## What to do in this function:
      - Create an array of 15 empty elements (there are a lot of fun ways to do this, and also very basic ways)
      - using a .map function on that range,
      - Make a list of 15 random restaurants from your list of 100 from your data request
      - Return only their name, category, and location
      - Return the new list of 15 restaurants so we can work on it separately in the HTML injector
